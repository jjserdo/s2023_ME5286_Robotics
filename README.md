Python codes used in ME 5286 Robotics Labs and Exams

## Laboratory 1: Hello Cobot World
Learning to interact with the cobot from UR5 using the teach pendant, roboDK, and with the Python API. The robot did some linear and joint movements between different points in 3D space.

## Laboratory 2: Straightness and Repeatability
Measured the repeatability and straightness of the UR5 and compared with its technical specifications.

## Laboratory 3: Gripper Control 
Learning how to use the gripper from Robotiq and controlling to do some basic controls and measuring force loads produced by different force and speed settings. Finally applied homogenous transformations as well in order to do a pick and place scenario

## Laboratory 4: Flashlight Assembly
Assembled a small flashlight through the use of the UR5 alone. Moves inclued twisting to screw parts together using a torque sensor in order to not damage the threads. Optimized to be as fast and repeatable as much as possible.
