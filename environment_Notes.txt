## [[4/8St]] Using VR Comp for training
[0744] Solving environment still not done since around [2100] <-
[0758] Created an environment **robot_v2** using Anaconda Navigator
	- <TRIED> installed **tensorflow-gpu** instead of **tensorflow**
		- needs python version earlier than 3.11
	- installed all dependencies except
		- **minimalmodbus**
		- **robodk through **pip**
[0803] Created an environment **robot_v3** using Anaconda Navigator
	- uses **python=3.8**
	- installed **tensorflow-gpu** instead of **tensorflow**
	- installed all dependencies except
		- **minimalmodbus**
		- **robodk** through **pip**
[0815] Tested environment **robot_v3**
[0815] Lab9_test.py can't import keras
[0816] installed **keras** using Anaconda Navigator
	- <???> will this still become slow
[0818] installed **keras-gpu** using Anaconda Navigator
[0821] Lab9_test.py shows version of tf and keras
	- gpu is not being detected
[0829] created new environment **robot_v4** using 
	- https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/12194
	- **python=3.8**
	- **tensorflow-gpu=2.3**
      - **tensorflow==2.3=mkl_py38h1fcfbd6_0**
	- added other dependencies
[0834] Lab9_test.py now shows 1 GPU
[0834] Lab9_JJ_v1.py ran
[0848] Still shows Epoch 1/100
[0911] super slow, GPU at 91 percent and CPU at 53 %
[0915] forced stop the process
[0918] created new environment **robot_v5** without tensorflow-gpu
	- python=3.10
	- all but robodk and minimalmodbus
[0918] deleted **robot_v2**
// hmm might just go back to robot_v2 but just deleted lmao  :(
[0925] Lab9_JJ_v1.py ran
	- much faster as it finished 1st epoch on [0929]
		- based on this then can finish within 4*100 = 400 minutes = around 7 hours
		- 226 seconds
	- 2nd epoch [0932]
		- 206 seconds
		- new estimate 6 hours
	- 3rd epoch [0936]
		- 209 seconds
		- new estimate is 5 hours and 58 minutes
		- expected finish is [1523]
[0937] JJ left to go study and will check at around [1238]
[1134] JJ returned because studying makes nose hurt
	- 38 epoch done at [1136]
		- previous epochs done at around 205 seconds  
		- new estimate 5.7 hours or 5 hours 42 mins
		- new expected finish is [1508]
[1526] JJ returned and found out that the weights were not save HAHAHA
	- 6 more hours baby
	- accuracy is at 99.61% tho so that's pretty crazy
[2028] JJ returned and at epoch 89
[2159] JJ returned and weights are saved and around 1gB
[2200] created Training_updates and saved to hardrive
	- transfered this file to hardrive as well
	- accuracy for test and val already high even at epoch 4 >95%
